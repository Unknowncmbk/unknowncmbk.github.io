	<div class="overview">
		<p>I thoroughly enjoy creating new software in my freetime, as it allows me to mess with various technologies in an always changing field. Below are some of my projects that I am currently working on, or have completed.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Note: More projects can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/Unknowncmbk?tab=repositories">GitHub</a>.

		<h3>UnblockMe Generator</h3>
		Status: <font color="green">Completed</font><br>
		Length: <font color="green">May 2017 - July 2017</font><br>
		<a href="https://github.com/Unknowncmbk/unblock-me-generator">Source Code</a>
		<h4>Goal</h4>
		Constraint satification problems have always been interesting to me, and some mobile puzzle games, like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/unblock-me-classic-block-puzzle/id315019111?mt=8">UnblockMe</a>, must have some interesting generation algorithms. The complexity of these puzzles must be polynominal.

		<h3>Epoch Time Tracker</h3>
		Status: <font color="green">Completed</font><br>
		Length: <font color="green">January 2017 - March 2017</font><br>
		<a href="https://github.com/Unknowncmbk/epoch-time-tracker">Source Code</a>
		<h4>Goal</h4>
		Startup companies need to keep their costs low, and a lot of time trackers out there do not have an easy to use clock in/clock out application with GitHub commit logging. This simple Slack integration allows companies to keep track of Engineers hours and allows them to see what commits were done every day.

		<h3>Pokemon Go Finder</h3>
		Status: <font color="green">Completed</font><br>
		Length: <font color="green">July 2016 - August 2016</font><br>
		<a href="https://github.com/Unknowncmbk/Pokemon-Go-Locator-Server">Source Code</a>
		<h4>Goal</h4>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PokÃ©mon_Go">Pokemon Go</a>, the mobile application, was a huge hit in the summer of 2016. Niantic, the company that created it, exposed their API calls allowing anyone to query their location services, getting the location of all Pokemon within a specified radius. This project stores those API calls, in order to give an advantage to players by expanding their search radius.

						<div class="caption">
						<p>The mobile app only shows a Pokemon in a couple block radius. This finder increases that limitation.</p>
