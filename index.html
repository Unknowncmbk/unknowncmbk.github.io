	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Stephen</span> and I am a Software Engineering Manager.</p>
	<p>I mainly specialize in backend computational systems, and leading software engineering teams. My inspiration for game design comes from RTS strategy games like Age of Empires II, Clash of Clans and dungeon crawlers like Binding of Isaac. My lifelong goal is to immortalize my family and friends in a video game with AI / audio recordings.
